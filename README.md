# URCA Analysis scripts
these are pretty basic plotting scripts.

The `make_slice.py` and `make_slice_w_grid.py` scripts are very basic and should likely not be used.

The `plot_figures.py` is meant to be more useable with some flexibility built in. The default values are meant to reflect the `myfix_urca1024` and `myfix_urca2048` sims. But this is the most general purpose script for making slices.

Will update to add descriptions for more of the scripts, but their names are soemwhat descriptive.
